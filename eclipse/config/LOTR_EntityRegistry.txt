#Use this file to register entities with the LOTR alignment system.
#
#An example format for registering an entity is as follows: (do not use spaces)
#name=lotr.MordorOrc,faction=MORDOR,targetEnemies=true,bonus=1
#
#'name' is the entity name, prefixed with the associated mod ID.
#The mod ID can be found in the Mod List on the main menu - for example, "lotr" for the LOTR mod.
#The entity name is not necessarily the in-game name. It is the name used to register the entity in the code.
#You may be able to discover the entity name in the mod's language file if there is one - otherwise, contact the mod author.
#The mod ID and entity name must be separated by a '.' character.
#Vanilla entities have no mod ID and therefore no prefix.
#
#'faction' can be HOBBIT, BREE, RANGER_NORTH, BLUE_MOUNTAINS, HIGH_ELF, GUNDABAD, ANGMAR, WOOD_ELF, DOL_GULDUR, DALE, DURINS_FOLK, LOTHLORIEN, DUNLAND, ISENGARD, FANGORN, ROHAN, GONDOR, MORDOR, DORWINION, RHUDEL, NEAR_HARAD, MORWAITH, TAURETHRIM, HALF_TROLL, DARK_HUORN, RUFFIAN, UTUMNO, HOSTILE
#
#'targetEnemies' can be true or false.
#If true, the entity will be equipped with AI modules to target its enemies.
#Actual combat behaviour may or may not be present, depending on whether the entity is designed with combat AI modules.
#
#'bonus' is the alignment bonus awarded to a player who kills the entity.
#It can be positive, negative, or zero, in which case no bonus will be awarded.
