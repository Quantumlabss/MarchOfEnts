After Months Of Work, it is finally here!
The DOS staff team has been hard at work creating March Of The Ents, a LOTR expansion mod!

March Of The Ents aims to fill some gaps the base LOTR mod has, adding lots of new armor and tool sets. some of these include the Lebennin Set

and Fingolfin set!

And many more!
Players will be able to craft and use most of these items, though a few will be uncraftable, only obtainable as a lore item or leadership item.
in addition to the items, we have also added some new achievements, which are lore accurate. These achievements are achievable from obtaining full sets of armor, or specific items.
This release of the mod is in beta, which means not everything is added. if you encounter bugs, or have feature suggestions, let us know!

We hope you are excited to try these new features, and we hope to continue to add new upgrades to the game.
